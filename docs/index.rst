accwidgets is a collection of widgets for PyQt for the AccPy community.
For learning about the different provided widgets visit their sub pages above. Many
of these widgets can be found integrated into RAD as well, but this repository allows
the usage in a pure PyQt context. Since this repository is the base for the equivalent
widgets found in RAD, migrating projects from RAD to pure PyQt is no problem.
