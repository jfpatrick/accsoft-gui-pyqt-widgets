Getting started

  * `Without Designer templates installed`_


The library can contain many different types of widgets, but all of them are separated into different namespaces.
For importing all widgets belonging to a specific sub-project, you can import them as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   from accwidgets.graph import ScrollingPlotWidget
   # ...
   widget = ScrollingPlotWidget()

You can learn how to use the widgets in 2 ways:

#. Check the API reference (can be found later in the documentation of individual widgets)
#. Try out `Interactive examples`_


Interactive examples
--------------------
Examples are normally found in the "examples" directory of the source code repository. All examples are grouped by
the widget they are related to. You run them using simple python command (remember to activate PyQt beforehand).

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   # Get the source code
   git clone git+ssh://git@gitlab.cern.ch:7999/acc-co/accsoft/gui/accsoft-gui-pyqt-widgets.git
   cd accsoft-gui-pyqt-widgets
   # Install the runtime dependencies
   pip install .
   # Run the example
   python examples/graph/minimum_example.py


Using with Qt Designer
----------------------

In order to load custom widgets into Qt Designer with PyQt, user has to specify ``PYQTDESIGNERPATH`` or place them
in one of the default locations (e.g. ``$HOME/.designer/plugins/python`` or
`library search paths known to Qt <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qcoreapplication.html#libraryPaths>`__). To list loaded
plugins, use menu "Help"â†’"About Plugins" in Qt Designer and see items listed under "libpyqt5.so" category.

With Designer templates installed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you have previously installed accwidgets' Qt Designer templates
(:ref:`How to <install:Enable Qt Designer templates>`), your ``designer`` command is already modified to load available
plugins automatically. Besides that, you are getting access to custom templates that appear in the "New Form" window,
under the "accwidgets/templates" category.

.. figure:: ./img/cern_templates.png
   :align: center

   New Form with custom templates


Without Designer templates installed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When opting out from using custom templates, it is still possible to load widget plugins into Qt Designer. We provide
a command ``accwidgets-cli designer-paths`` that will print a path value, suitable for
assigning to ``PYQTDESIGNERPATH``. Thus, you may access accwidgets in Qt Designer by running it as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   PYQTDESIGNERPATH="$(accwidgets-cli designer-paths):$PYQTDESIGNERPATH" designer
