Submission process
==================


Submitting your widgets will include the following steps, based on
`GitLab's Forking Workflow <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html>`__:

#. Create an issue in JIRA describing your widget
#. Fork the repository
#. Implement your widgets, examples, tests, designer plugins and write documentation
#. Test your widgets, examples and the designer plugin
#. Open a merge request
#. Your changes will be reviewed by us and approved if they fit all the requirements.

In our review process, we make sure that the submitted widget is suitable for the library, that all requirements
(designer plugin, documentation, examples, tests...)  are met and that your code follows the repositories code
conventions.
